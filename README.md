# Ælfric's Lives of Saints Digitalized

This is the files of the [Wikisource electronic edition of Ælfric's Lives of Saints](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/%C3%86lfric%27s_Lives_of_Saints) before wikification. Most of the work is done, but not all.

If you are interested in this, you might be interested in [my thesis](https://github.com/rwmpelstilzchen/thesis) as well, which uses this as its corpus.
